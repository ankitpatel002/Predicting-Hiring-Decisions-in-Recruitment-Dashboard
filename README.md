# Predicting-Hiring-Decisions-in-Recruitment-Dashboard

I am excited to share my latest project, a dynamic and insightful dashboard built using Power BI, designed to predict hiring decisions in recruitment processes. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, which you can find here, this dashboard provides a detailed analysis and visualization of various recruitment metrics.

Key Features:
KPIs Overview: Includes metrics such as the total number of job seekers, average age, gender distribution, and average scores across personality, interview, and skill assessments.
Interactive Slicers: Allows users to filter data by gender, hiring decision (hired vs. not hired), and education level for a customized view of the data.
Visual Analytics:
Stacked Column Charts: Visualize total scores by education level and age groups, providing insights into how these factors influence hiring outcomes.
Stacked Bar Chart: Displays total scores across different education levels, highlighting key trends.
Pie Charts: Illustrate the distribution of candidates by previous companies, hiring decisions by gender, total scores by recruitment stages, and overall total scores.
This project highlights the power of data visualization in enhancing recruitment strategies, offering a clear perspective on how different variables impact hiring decisions. It serves as a valuable tool for recruiters, HR professionals, and data enthusiasts who are looking to leverage data for more informed decision-making.

I invite you to explore the dataset and the dashboard, and I look forward to connecting with professionals who are interested in data analytics, recruitment, and potential collaborations. Your feedback and insights would be greatly appreciated!
